Tools
=====

A tool in Pharmpy is an implementation of a pharmacometric method. The Pharmpy tools typically create multiple
candidate models according to the tool selected, estimate those, and make some sort of selection of the best model. If
possible, Pharmpy will parallelize the runs. All tools are independent of the estimation software chosen, the only part
of the tool that is software specific is the estimation.

The tools can be split into two sections: Pharmpy tools and tools connected to PsN. Pharmpy tools
are implemented in Pharmpy, while the tools connected to PsN allows for parsing and presenting
results from PsN tools. Documentation of PsN tools can be found :ref:`here <psn_with_pharmpy>`.

.. note::

    In order to run any of the tools you need to have a configuration file set up with a path to NONMEM, instructions
    can be found :ref:`here <config_page>`.
